                          Aspire AP is usually referred students by their schools and local authorities or
statutory agencies such as Youth Offending Teams or Social Services. The first
step in making an initial referral is to contact the Head Teacher.</p>
                        <p>
                            Acceptance on an Aspire AP School placement is contingent on a successful
interview during which the young person, their referrer, and a parent or
caregiver discuss and agree on expectations and boundaries.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Referrers will be kept up to date on progress and behavior on a regular basis,
and open, two-way contact is encouraged.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         Referrers receive a progress report each term and can attend a review where
more conversation takes place, and plans for the next stages are formed.

Support for onward transition is provided in the run-up to the end of a
placement.
A final review is held in the last week, and referrers, along with parents or
caregivers, are invited to an awards ceremony.

                            people with special educational, social, emotional, and behavioral challenges
                            on a regular basis at Aspire AP. Based on rigorous initial and continuing
                            evaluation, our staff team is prepared to deal with students who have various
                            learning needs and differentiate work appropriately and efficiently.</p>
                        <p>
                            Our small group sizes and high staff-to-student ratios create an environment
                            conducive to nurturing effective learning. This means that we can customize
                            the curriculum and degree of support for each student, allowing them to learn
                            and succeed. Our educational environment is well-structured and has distinct
                            boundaries.

                            Aspire AP School agrees behaviour principles are formed with students and
                            outlined in a &quot;contract&quot; that everyone signs at the start of the placement.
                            Using our Behavior for Learning Assessment, staff, parents, and young people
                            identify and establish targets in areas that present challenges for them and
                            support is then provided to help them develop.

                            Staff use strategies to promote and regularly recognize positive behaviour and
                            clear and consistent sanctions for inappropriate behavior. Students are taught
                            that their actions have consequences, and in many cases, they begin to change
                            their behaviour as a result.

                        <p>
                            Students are always supervised while in school. Unless excused, students are
                            expected to attend all sessions (morning and afternoon). We think that high
                            attendance is essential for success, and we work hard with our young people
                            and their families to overcome any obstacles to regular attendance.

                        <p>At Aspire AP School, we are committed to working together to establish an
                            environment free of bullying. We will promote and assist students in treating
                            one another with respect and kindness, we will oppose any bullying we witness
                            or hear, and we will implement appropriate sanctions for bullying. If students
                            or parents have any concerns regarding bullying, they should communicate
                            with an Aspire AP School staff member. Alternatively, they can use our online
                            form to notify us. If we learn that a student is being bullied, we will intervene
                            swiftly, sensitively, and effectively to ensure that the bullying does not
                            continue. We will assist the student both during and after the resolution of the
                            issue..</p>
