                      <li style="list-style: none;margin-top:15px;padding:5px">     1. Do not post any personal information online, such as your phone number,

<li style="list-style: none;padding:5px;"> 2. Speak up! If you have seen something online that made you feel worried,
unsafe, or uneasy, please talk to an adult you trust.</li>
<li style="list-style: none;padding:5px;">3. Ask the question: Why are they &quot;your online friend&quot; or &quot;follower&quot; if you

        do this by using search engines on social networking websites..</li>
        <li style="list-style: none;padding:5px;"> 5. Use caution when &quot;posting&quot; or &quot;sharing&quot; a photo online. Remember that
